Here is where the proposal will go.

After we are done editing, we should probably use Word or
another processor to make it look pretty, and save it here as
a .pdf.

URSell

A place for students to buy, sell, or even barter with other students and university members.
They can sell their old textbooks, buy a new couch, even earn some money for tutoring.
URSell is the place to advertise and search for all of these.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
==========================
Each requirement here is roughly divided by each website page, detailing what
is needed from the user and what is provided.

Home Page
-------------------------
  - Basic information about the site and its goals will be stated here, while
  showcasing some of the content available on the site. It will also give users
  an option to sign-up or login.

User Sign-up
--------------------------
  - Users must provide the following information to sign up to the site:
    - Unique username
    - Password (at least 8 characters, with one alpha character and one numeric character)
    - Email ending in @uregina.ca (with an option to be validated later)
    - Optional photo

User Login
--------------------------
  - Users must provide their:
    - Username
    - Password
  to properly log in to use the website.

User Profile
--------------------------
  - The following information about specific users will be shown here:
    - Username
    - Email (optional)
    - Previous posts
    - User photo
    - About user

Post Page
--------------------------
  Here will contain all current posts made by users. They will be separated by
  categories, and each post will contain:
    - Title
    - User
    - General Description (with optional hashtags)
    - Photo
    - Comments
    - Contact info

In-site Email
--------------------------
  Since it is crucial for users to communicate privately with each other, we
  will provide a in-site email (similar to that in UR Courses) for users to communicate.
  Since users will also have their @uregina.ca emails, we will offer email notifications
  for this feature as well.


SOFTWARE QUALITIES
==========================

The most important quality for our website is user-friendliness. We want users
to easily find any content they are looking for, so we will offer a quick,
easy-to-navigate website with many categories and a simple search.

Because we want a user-friendly website, we will also consider a lot of interface
design and aesthetics when building the website. Any site that is visually
appealing also becomes easier to use.

Lastly, we aim to practice general security precautions, such as input cleansing
and password hashing.
